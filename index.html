<h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1> <!--Normal header-->
<h2>Yeah, but have you really thought bout it?</h2> <!--Slighly bigger header-->
<h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before</h3> <!--Decent sized header-->
<h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messsed up too</h4> <!--a noticable header-->
<!--Add some code here-->
<p>Making a pizzaa is similar to coding. There are certain things we have to do first. Like marking the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have everything you need to make many different pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand.</p>
